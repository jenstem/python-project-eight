## Description

I wanted to a create a Python game inspired by the NYT's app Wordle.  The app contains functionality to randomly select a five letter word.  Regex has been added to the code to allow the user to better read the game's comments and the randomizer function has been debugged to stop the same word from appearing over and over again.
